**What hardware do you use?**

At work I use a Thinkpad t480s running [nixOS](https://nixos.org/). I'm still an Apple guy at heart but the disaster that was the butterfly keyboard forced me to look elsewhere. The t480s has 24GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD for the main drive. I'd consider heading back to an Apple laptop now that the butterfly keyboard is gone and Apple Silicon is here but I'm very comfortable using this Thinkpad for work.

At home I use a desktop PC I built for gaming as my primary desktop thanks to [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about). I love typing on my <s>[Anne Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Anne-PRO-Mechanical-Keyboard-Programmable/dp/B07J4HH6YZ)</s> [GMMK Pro](https://www.pcgamingrace.com/products/glorious-gmmk-pro-75-barebone-black) mechanical keyboard with Gazzew U4 Boba switches for a quieter feel.

My phone is an iPhone 11 it's fantastic.

**And what software?**

I'm a [big][dotfiles] user of [Emacs][emacs]. I use [mu4e](https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html) for email, [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) for tasks and notes, [Ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) for auto-complete, [magit](https://magit.vc/) for git, [ivy-feedwrangler](/writing/introducing-ivy-feedwrangler) for RSS.

Linux apps I use on my work laptop are: [Signal](https://www.signal.org/), [Tilix](https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web/) or [Alacritty](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty) for terminals, [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) for launching, and [i3wm](https://github.com/i3/i3) as my window manager.
