**What hardware do you use?**

At work I use a [desktop workstation](/writing/new-workstation) running [NixOS](https://nixos.org/).

At home I use a desktop PC I built for gaming as my primary desktop thanks to [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about). I love typing on my <s>[Anne Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Anne-PRO-Mechanical-Keyboard-Programmable/dp/B07J4HH6YZ)</s> [GMMK Pro](https://www.pcgamingrace.com/products/glorious-gmmk-pro-75-barebone-black) mechanical keyboard with Gazzew U4 Boba switches for a quieter feel.

My phone is an iPhone 11 it's fantastic.

<s>I'm a [big][dotfiles] user of [Emacs][emacs]. I use [mu4e](https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html) for email, [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) for tasks and notes, [Ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) for auto-complete, [magit](https://magit.vc/) for git, [ivy-feedwrangler](/writing/introducing-ivy-feedwrangler) for RSS.</s> I've switched back to Vim for better [LSP support](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim).
