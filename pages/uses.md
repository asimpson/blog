**What hardware do you use?**

At work I use a still-going-strong 2014 11" Macbook Air. I love small computers and this Air is my second favorite small computer behind the [12" Powerbook G4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_G4) which was the first computer I ever purchased.

At home I dual-boot on a PC I built between Windows 10 for games and Linux for everything else. I love typing on my [Anne Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Anne-PRO-Mechanical-Keyboard-Programmable/dp/B07J4HH6YZ) mechanical keyboard.

I use an iPhone 6s+ for my phone and plan on using it (and repairing it) until it falls apart.

**And what software?**

I'm a [big][dotfiles] user of [Emacs][emacs]. I use [mu4e](https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html) for email, [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) for tasks and notes, [Ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) for auto-complete, [magit](https://magit.vc/) for git, [ivy-feedwrangler](/writing/introducing-ivy-feedwrangler) for RSS, and [erc](https://www.gnu.org/software/erc/) (with [znc](https://github.com/znc/znc)) for IRC.

Other Mac specific apps I use on a daily basis are: [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/), [MenuMeters](https://github.com/yujitach/MenuMeters), [1Password](https://1password.com/), [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/), [Turbo Boost Switcher Pro](http://tbswitcher.rugarciap.com/), and [Hammerspoon](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon).

My browser for general browsing is Safari and for web development is Firefox.

I enjoy writing code in [Javascript/Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Common Lisp](https://common-lisp.net/), and recently [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

**Any online services?**

As far as online services go I use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) (at the moment) to host this site, [Hover](https://hover.com/U84GCox3) for domains, [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/?STKI=14274077) for email, [Feedwrangler](https://feedwrangler.net/) manages my RSS feeds, [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:asimpson) is my online trapper keeper, and I use [Backblaze](https://secure.backblaze.com/r/01c40o) for online backup,
