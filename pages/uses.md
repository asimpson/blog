**What hardware do you use?**

At work I use a Thinkpad t480s running [Pop_OS](https://system76.com/pop). I'm still an Apple guy at heart but [the current state of Apple laptops](/writing/0-14) forced me to look elsewhere. The t480s has 24GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD for the main boot drive, and a 128GB SSD as a secondary Windows install.

At home I dual-boot on a PC I built between Windows 10 for games and Linux for everything else. I love typing on my [Anne Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Anne-PRO-Mechanical-Keyboard-Programmable/dp/B07J4HH6YZ) mechanical keyboard.

I use an iPhone 6s+ for my phone and plan on using it (and repairing it) until it falls apart.

**And what software?**

I'm a [big][dotfiles] user of [Emacs][emacs]. I use [mu4e](https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html) for email, [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) for tasks and notes, [Ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) for auto-complete, [magit](https://magit.vc/) for git, [ivy-feedwrangler](/writing/introducing-ivy-feedwrangler) for RSS, and [erc](https://www.gnu.org/software/erc/) (with [znc](https://github.com/znc/znc)) for IRC.

Linux apps I use on my work laptop are: [Signal](https://www.signal.org/), [CopyQ](https://hluk.github.io/CopyQ/), [Window Corner Preview](https://github.com/medenagan/window-corner-preview), [AutoKey](https://github.com/autokey/autokey), [system-monitor](https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/gnome-shell-system-monitor-applet), [Tilix](https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web/) or [Alacritty](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty) for terminals, and [gTile](https://github.com/gTile/gTile).

Mac specific apps I use: [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/), [MenuMeters](https://github.com/yujitach/MenuMeters), [1Password](https://1password.com/), [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/), [Turbo Boost Switcher Pro](http://tbswitcher.rugarciap.com/), and [Hammerspoon](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon).

My browser is Firefox.

I enjoy writing code in [Javascript/Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Common Lisp](https://common-lisp.net/), and recently [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

**Any online services?**

As far as online services go I use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) (at the moment) to host this site, [Hover](https://hover.com/U84GCox3) for domains, [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/?STKI=14274077) for email, [Feedwrangler](https://feedwrangler.net/) manages my RSS feeds, [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:asimpson) is my online trapper keeper, and I use [Backblaze](https://secure.backblaze.com/r/01c40o) and [rsync.net](https://www.rsync.net/) for online backup,
