**Who are you, and what do you do?**

I'm Adam Simpson (I write this site) and I work on the interwebs at [Sparkbox][sparkbox] and live life with my wonderful wife Christi and our daughter Ellie.

**What hardware do you use?**

At work I use a still-going-strong 2014 11" Macbook Air. I love small computers and this Air is my second favorite small computer behind the 12" Powerbook G4 which was the first computer I ever purchased.

At home I dual-boot on a PC I built between Windows 10 for games and Linux for everything else.

**And what software?**

I'm a [big][dotfiles] user of [Emacs][emacs]. I use [mu4e](https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html) for email, [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) for tasks and notes, [Ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) for auto-complete, [magit](https://magit.vc/) for git, [ivy-feedwrangler](/writing/introducing-ivy-feedwrangler) for RSS, and [erc](https://www.gnu.org/software/erc/) (with [znc](https://github.com/znc/znc)) for IRC.

Other Mac specific apps I use on a daily basis are: [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/), [MenuMeters](https://github.com/yujitach/MenuMeters), [1Password](https://1password.com/), [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/), [Turbo Boost Switcher Pro](http://tbswitcher.rugarciap.com/), and [Hammerspoon](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon).

My browser for general browsing is Safari and for development is Firefox.

I enjoy writing code in [Javascript/Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Common Lisp](https://common-lisp.net/), and recently [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
