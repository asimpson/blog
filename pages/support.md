# Support

I use the following services just about every day and they all offer discounts or other incentives for folks to recommend the service to other people. Signing up for one of these services using the links below helps support me and this blog. Thanks!

## Mint Mobile
I recently switched to [Mint Mobile](http://fbuy.me/oR9jO) from T-Mobile and I haven't noticed any change in the quality of service. Their website is easy to use and the price of $240/year for 8GB of data every month is pretty great.

## Fastmail
I've been a [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/?STKI=14274077) user for years now and I don't have a single complaint about the service or company. Highly recommended if all you care about is IMAP service that "just works."

## Hover
Years ago I switched from GoDaddy to [Hover](https://hover.com/U84GCox3) and haven't looked back. They're a great, no-frills DNS service.

## Backblaze
I've been using [Backblaze](https://secure.backblaze.com/r/01c40o) for years and absolutely love the service and company. Not only is their product top-notch but the data they publish about [hard drive reliability](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/hard-drive-test-data.html) is incredibly useful.
