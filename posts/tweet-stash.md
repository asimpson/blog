Two tweets that I've had stuck in my tabs for _awhile_ and decided to stash them here.

## Dismal laptops
The first one is a tweet from Dave Nanian, [creator of SuperDuper](https://www.shirt-pocket.com/), which paints a good picture of how bad Apple laptops had gotten from 2016-2019.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Even thought I’m a macOS developer, when I’m on vacation and don’t need to do development, I travel with a Windows laptop, because my Mac laptops are kind of awful.<br><br>Awful to the point where I’ve considered installing macOS in a VM on said laptop.</p>&mdash; Dave Nanian (@dnanian) <a href="https://twitter.com/dnanian/status/1189994012150812672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2019</a></blockquote>

## Talk show entrances

This next tweet is hysterical. It's a clip of Nic Cage being _hyped_ in the 90s when he's introduced to on a talk show in England. The thread is worth reading as you'll also see Chris Farley's Letterman entrance which is even more incredible.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Please enjoy the greatest talk-show entrance of all time: Nicolas Cage on Wogan, 1992. <a href="https://t.co/hH4CJmj371">pic.twitter.com/hH4CJmj371</a></p>&mdash; Nick de Semlyen (@NickdeSemlyen) <a href="https://twitter.com/NickdeSemlyen/status/1199726909686460416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2019</a></blockquote>
