Today I removed two of my most-used apps on my phone, [Apollo](https://apolloapp.io/) and [Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/). It feels like the end of an era. 

Twitter and Reddit were both social websites that are/were terrible without a lot of cultivation and effort, but over the years I had shaped my experience on those services to be pretty good thanks in large part to Apollo and Tweetbot being such powerful tools. 

Ironically the only social web thing I still use (outside of Instagram) is [RSS](https://feedbin.com/). I will probably spin up a Mastodon instance here eventually but for now I've subscribed to folks via Mastodon's RSS support and it's good enough for now.

I guess I just wanted to give a shout out to the devs of Apollo and Tweetbot: thank you for making such great apps, I will miss them.
