Great post from my friend and co-worker Bryan Braun on the value of demoing.

> It didn’t matter that his demos weren’t fully built, or available for anyone to use. We simply needed to see it, in order to understand.

I find this is true for any kind of project: hobby or professional. Feedback — that elusive crucial ingredient to a good product — tends to arrive when someone else can see/hear/touch/examine what you're working on.
