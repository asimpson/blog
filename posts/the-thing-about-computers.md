> Maybe because I lived through this — maybe because I’m a certain age — I believe that that freedom to use my computer exactly how I want to, to make it do any crazy thing I can think of — is _the_ thing about computers.

I literally cannot agree with this more strongly! It's been open in a tab on my phone since Brent published it and I can't stop thinking about it.

I think there's a line somewhere where convenience and ease-of-use meets this freedom to do anything computing ideal. I think I will always bend toward the _freedom_ side over convenience when it comes to my personal computers. Conversely, I think I bend towards the _convenience_ side over freedom when it comes to my phone. I'm not sure why that is.
