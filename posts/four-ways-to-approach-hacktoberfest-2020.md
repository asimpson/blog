Hacktoberfest 2020 is here! I can't believe 2020 is winding down, good riddance!

I've been talking about Hacktoberfest with my co-worker [Bryan](https://www.bryanbraun.com/) and I thought of four different approaches to Hacktoberfest this year that I wanted to share.

<aside class="pa2 bg-light-gray">If you stop and think about it Hacktoberfest is a weird event: tying an incentive to the number of Pull-Requests a person submits probably (I could be wrong on this but I doubt it) produces a flood of low-effort and low-quality pull-requests across the open source landscape. However, the event is here to stay so what are some ways developers who care about quality and open-source can use this extra attention to make things better not worse?</aside>


## Dependency scrub
This is probably common everywhere but the Javascript/web communities are filled with npm packages. It's packages all the way down. I think it would be interesting to approach this month looking for ways to remove third-party code from projects you love and use frequently.

## Polygot Achievement
Try to submit four pull requests in four different languages. As [Drew DeVault writes](https://drewdevault.com/2018/03/17/Hack-everything-without-fear.html): Hack everything without fear!

## Unknown lands
Similar to the previous one it could be fun to submit PRs against a project you've never been in before that's in a language you don't know. This could be anything from diving into Wordpress core, to working on some C for some Linux utilities, or even submitting PRs to open source Mac/iOS applications.

## Bug doctor
Go into a project and find the oldest issues and try to resolve them via PR. This is inspired by [Richard Schneeman's video](https://schneems.com/2020/09/22/triage-with-me-11-issues-2-prs-in-15-hours/) and post where he runs through 11 issues and 2 PRs in a hour and a half.

How are you approaching Hacktoberfest this year? My <a href="mailto:~asimpson/public-inbox@lists.sr.ht?Subject=Re:%20Four%20ways%20to%20approach%20Hacktoberfest%202020">public inbox</a> is open, let me know!
