Dead Cells is an incredible single-player fighting platformer (not sure the proper term for it). It only took a few minutes before I felt like a total badass running around squashing baddies. However, that feeling is tempered by the fact that this game is quite fiendishly difficult.

It's available on Steam for Mac, Linux, and Windows. It's also available on most consoles, including the Switch, and recently iOS.

I was so impressed with this game I went hunting around for information on the creators of the game, Motion Twin. I found this documentary on Youtube about the studio and the game which is quite good:

There's also this video which highlights some of the smart ways the developers made the game feel better to players:

If you're looking for a new game or something different I highly recommend checking out Dead Cells.
