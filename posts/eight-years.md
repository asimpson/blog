Eight years ago I started working at Sparkbox. Here are some of things that have happened since I started:

- The Cubs won a World Series.
- Facebook released a small Javascript library called React.
- The iPhone 5 was unveiled the week _after_ I started.

Time flies when you're having fun.

Thank you Sparkbox team for giving me an opportunity to work with ya'll and for making me a better developer and person. Let's keep it rolling!
