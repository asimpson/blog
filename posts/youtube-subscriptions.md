I've been using `youtube-subscriptions` for a few months now and I really enjoy it. It's described as a:

> terminal client to browse youtube subscriptions

It's great to quickly see any new videos right in the terminal and videos play via [`mpv`](https://mpv.io/) or [`vlc`](https://www.videolan.org/index.html)!
