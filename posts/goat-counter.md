> What seems to be lacking is a “middle ground” that offers useful statistics to answer business questions, without becoming a specialized marketing tool requiring in-depth training to use effectively. Furthermore, some tools have privacy issues (especially Google Analytics). I saw there was space for a new service and ended up putting my original idea in the freezer and writing GoatCounter.

I agree 100% with this assessment and I'm excited about Goatcounter. I setup a free instance of Goatcounter for this site as a way to kick the tires on it. So far, I'm enjoying that it's privacy respecting and doesn't drag down page performance.
