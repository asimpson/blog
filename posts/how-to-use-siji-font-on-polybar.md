Nice guide on Reddit about how to use the [Siji font](https://github.com/stark/siji) with polybar.

> [..] install the siji font, and then run `"view.sh"` in the terminal. If you get an error, try to launch the `install.sh` again. You'll get a list of all the glyphs available, select the one you want [..] to use and then look where it says "Character 0x00e002" or something like that.

Of note is that you'll end up with weird looking glyphs but siji will interpret it correctly. This is because Siji maps character codes to different icons than other fonts do.
