I can’t believe I’m writing this but after 9 and a half years today is my last day at [Sparkbox](https://sparkbox.com).

Now, I know it can be problematic to think about work like your (extended) family but when you work at the same place through your twenties and early thirties, have 3 different apartments, buy a house, and have two kids it’s impossible not to view that place differently. I can confidently say Sparkbox changed my life. The team there will always have a special place in my heart.

So where to? Well, I’m super stoked to be joining [Grafana](https://grafana.com) as a Senior Software Engineer on their Cloud Data team! I’m looking forward to writing more Go, solving new problems, and learning from the stellar folks there.

Here we go…
