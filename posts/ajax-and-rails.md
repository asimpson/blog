This is just a short post to save a few links and document that "Server Javascript Responses" in Rails are still useful in 2018/19.

## Lifecycle of SJR

The basic idea behind Server Javascript Responses (SJR) is diagrammed below:

SJR works like this:

1.  A User submits a form that has the Rails attribute `remote=true` on the form tag which makes the form submission happen via AJAX. See the [Rails guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/working_with_javascript_in_rails.html) for more information.

2.  The server receives the data payload and processes a response.

3.  The Response from the server is a blob of JS *not JSON* that usually comes from a matching `name.js.erb` template.

4.  The User's browser receives the JS blog and evals the JS to update the page.
