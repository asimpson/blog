I was recently debugging some `.htaccess` redirects and wanted to know two things:

1. How was my URL changing as it went through the redirects?
2. How many redirects occurred?

I quickly got fed up with testing in the browser because of 301/302 redirect caching issues. With my limited `curl` knowledge I knew I could dump headers and that would show me the redirect code and the URL but figuring out how many hops occurred was frustrating.

I searched around and found this [*very* helpful post](https://www.chrislatta.org/articles/web/curl/track-redirects-curl-command-line) by  Chris Latta. The `curl` command from the post introduced me to the fact that `curl` has basic templating support! I read through `man curl` and noticed there were other built-in variables besides `url_effective`, like `num_redirects`! This was exactly what I wanted. Below is what I eventually ended up with:

```
curl -LSs -D - -o /dev/null -w 'Final URL: %{url_effective} \nNumber of Redirects: %{num_redirects} '
```

I added this to my dotfiles as an alias called `redirects`, here is a sample of what the output looks like:

```

`curl` might be one of the most important tools I have at my disposal for working with HTTP requests and I feel like I've only begun to scratch the surface of what it can do.
