I've tried a few blog commenting systems in my day but have never really been happy with any of them. Part of the problem with comment systems is that a discussion forum is not a blog.

Recently I've noticed a few other folks ([Drew](https://drewdevault.com/), [Ethan](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/replyin/), [Tom](https://macwright.com/2020/08/01/recently.html), and [Jonnie](https://destroytoday.com/blog/reply-link-in-rss-feed-posts)) around the internet turning to email as the solution to have conversations about the things on their respective websites. I liked how Drew's solution not only leveraged email but mailing lists! The benefits are pretty obvious to me:

- Folks are comfortable composing messages in their email client of choice
- A mailing list is public
- A mailing list is searchable
- A mailing list facilities conversation.

So I'm gonna give it a spin. [Here is my public inbox](https://lists.sr.ht/~asimpson/public-inbox).

Of course I'll always accept direct email at [adam@adamsimpson.net](mailto:adam@adamsimpson.net).
